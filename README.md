# Motivation

Last night Indiana Jones was on the TV and you watched it. You thought maybe
being an archaeologist sounds like a fun career. Then you realized how often
Indiana Jones was in a life-threatening situation and decided that maybe the
leather jacket/adventuring archaeologist isn't for you. However, you realize
you're taking this amazing visualization course and maybe you can leverage 
some of those skills to inspect certain historical places. So you decide
to look at the [Pleiades](https://pleiades.stoa.org/) dataset and see if you
can find some interesting relationships.

You decide to download the locations dataset from that resource at
<http://atlantides.org/downloads/pleiades/dumps/pleiades-locations-20210201.csv.gz>.
You have a look at the dataset and it is a lot of complex data. Maybe you can
use visualization to help make some sense of the complex data. There is also a
README file for the dataset at
<http://atlantides.org/downloads/pleiades/dumps/README.txt> which describes the
fields of the CSV file. There are other datasets available on that site which
you can use.

## Understanding the data

As with real-world projects, acronyms and special terminology 
are prevalent.  Thus, you may need to conduct some research,
like reading the data description online or googling terms you're unsure of.
You may also ask questions on Discord or
<http://VisGuides.org>
if you need
help. 

## Goals of the analysis

The goal is to create visualizations that 
maximize our understanding of the data.
In addition to some obvious factual information, such as:

1. What is the oldest place in each location?
2. What is the distribution of structure types around the world?
3. Can you make a map of an ancient city?
4. How do newer settlements in a civilization absorb older ones?

There are also some less obvious questions, such as:

1. Are there any interesting patterns or trends in the data?
2. What are the outliers?
3. What insight can we gain from multi-variate visualizations of the data?
4. Are there any relationships between the different time ages?

Your boss shows you a bar chart they made in excel and asks for, "something
like this." However, you know from your insightful vis lectures that single
graphics of old-fashioned pie charts, bar charts, bubble charts, and line
graphs might not be very insightful or aesthetically impressive. We resolve to
do better (and maybe get a promotion)!
